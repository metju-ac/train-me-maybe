    The RegioJet\'s Affiliate API is a set of endpoints that help your application integrate with RegioJet.

    The API is organized arount [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Our API uses standard HTTP methods, authentication, and status codes.

    # Authentication
    Authentication to the API is performed via [HTTP Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) for all endpoints listed in this documentation with the exception of `/users/authenticate`, which uses bearer token.

    API requests without authentication will fail.

    All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS).

    # Errors

    RegioJet uses conventional HTTP status codes in responses to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

    In general:
      * `2xx` codes indicate success;
      * `4xx` codes indicate an error that failed given the information provided in request.
      * `5xx` codes indicate an error with RegioJet's servers.

          To obtain account code you should go through these two steps:

            2. Authenticate user's token using endpoint `users/authenticate`, which will return `accountCode` in response.
